## CMPUT275-Winter2017

CMPUT 274/275 is a 2-course introduction to computer science. It integrates the introductory computing courses (CMPUT 174/175) with the second-year introductory algorithms course (CMPUT 204) and the second year introductory systems course (CMPUT 201).  The course uses a problem-based approach to motivate the concepts and illustrate their application.  It will be using the Arduino concrete-computing platform so that students will both become familiar with the typical screen-keyboard-mouse style of computing, but also the kind of embedded computing that is behind the scenes in the many devices that surround us.  Delivery is hands on, with the classes taking place in a lab environment.
